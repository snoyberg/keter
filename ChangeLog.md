  accidentally flipped. PR #282
- In case reading any one of `*-host-response-file` fails, keter now logs a warning,
  and falls back to builtin defaults. Before 2.1.3, this is a fatal error.

## 2.1.2

- Bump bounds:

  ```cabal
  aeson >=2.0.0 && <2.2 (latest: 2.2.0.0)
  bytestring >=0.10.12 && <0.12 (latest: 0.12.0.0)
  mtl >=2.2.2 && <2.3 (latest: 2.3.1)
  optparse-applicative >=0.16.1 && <0.18 (latest: 0.18.1.0)
  transformers >=0.5.6 && <0.6 (latest: 0.6.1.1)
  unix >=2.7.2 && <2.8 (latest: 2.8.1.1)
  warp-tls >=3.0.3 && <3.4.0 (latest: 3.4.0)
  ```

## 2.1.1

- Bump unix-compat bound to accept 0.7
- Add upper bounds to all dependencies in the main library
- Run cabal-fmt
- Drop support for stackage lts-17 and lts-18
  I don't think it's worth mainting these with the aeson issues involved.
  Eg you open yourself to a [DoS attack](https://github.com/haskell/aeson/issues/864)
  by staying on these old versions

## 2.1

Please reference `MigrationGuide-2.1.md` for in-depth documentation on breaking
changes to be aware of, examples of said changes, and potential
solutions/workarounds for them if you plan on upgrading to this version of
`keter`.

- Log naming and directory scheme has changed for both main keter logs and app logs.
  Old logs were named `dir/current.log` for the current log and `%Y%m%d_%H%M%S.log`
  (`time` package conventions) for rotated logs.
  Current logs have been brought up one level and named after their old directory:
  `logs/keter/current.log` -> `logs/keter.log`
  Rotated logs will now simply have `.1` `.2` ascending appended to the name of
  the base logs
  rather than be named after the date and time they were rotated at:
  `logs/keter/20230413_231415.log` -> `logs/keter.log.1`
  `logs/__builtin__/20230413_231415.log` -> `logs/__builtin__.log.1`
  `logs/app-foo/20230413_231415.log` -> `logs/app-foo.log.1`
  Please update anything that depended on the old log naming and directory
  conventions accordingly.
- Added the `rotate-logs` option (default: true) in the keter config file.
  When true, the main keter (non-app!) logs will rotate like they have in
  previous versions.
  When false, the main keter logs will emit straight to stderr; this is useful
  e.g. if you're running keter via systemd, which captures stderr output for
  you.
- Internal logging implementation has been switched over to `fast-logger`
  instead of the old in-house logging solution.
  Please be aware that compared to the old logging solution, the usage of
  `fast-logger` does not 100% guarantee consistent time ordering. If anything
  previously depended on tailing the last line of a log and critically assumed
  that messages will be in order, it should now parse via timestamp instead.
- The `LogMessage` ADT has been removed.
- Replaced individual logging calls with TH splice -style calls where sensible
  to have access to source location info.
- Updated log message format to make use of the additional info:
  `"$time|$module$:$line_num|$log_level> $msg"`
- Added `Keter.Context`, exposing the new `KeterM` monad and related functions.
  This monad carries a mappable global config and logger around, eliminating
  the need to pass various configuration data and the logger to everything.
- Refactored most `Keter.*` module functions to be actions in `KeterM`
  Please anticipate breaking changes for anything written against the exposed
  API.

## 2.0.1

- Force usage of http-reverse-proxy versions above 0.6.0.1.
  This prevents a DoS attack on a head request followed by a post.

## 2.0

- Improve missing sudo error messages in postgres plugin.
- Reorganized most Haskell source files into /src.
- Dropped support for http-client < 0.5.0.
- Removed 'default' package.
- All "Data" modules are now "Keter" modules.
- Testing library switched from "hspec" to "tasty".
- Move Network.Http.ReverseProxy.Rewrite into Keter.Rewrite
- Move Codec.Archive.TempTarball into Keter.TempTarball
- Hide Keter.Aeson.KeyHelper
- Stop re-exporting common and rewrite from types
- Common no longer re-exports half of Haskell
- Rename Types to Config
- Move Common out of Config into root

## 1.9

- Update status code of missing host responses.
  They now emit a 502 on missing host, and 404 on host not found
- Always restart keter in the nix config for systemd.
  It turns out that keter may exit with exit code 0 under load testing.
  Changing from on-failure to always in systemd should bring it back up.
- Squash proxy exceptions if they occur and serve a default or custom error
  response.
  Emits the exception to the log.
- Add incoming folder to the CI build.

## 1.8.4

- Get rid of ominious warning at the top.
  Thanks to /u/Opposite-Platypus-99
  for pointing this out.

## 1.8.3

- HTML escape X-forwarded-host response as well.

## 1.8.2

- Fix XSS issue in the default response for host not found.
  (special thanks to Max @ulidtko for spotting and fixing this)

## 1.8.1

- Fix haddock build

## 1.8

- Add NixOS support
- Describe debug port in readme.
- Improve ensure alive error message due to
  <https://github.com/snoyberg/keter/issues/236>
- Add `missing-host-response-file` and `unknown-host-response-file`
  to the global keter config, which replace the default responses.
- All missing-host responses will now fill the requested host in the
  `X-Forwarded-Host: HOSTNAME` header, where HOSTNAME is the requested host.
  This is done because the default response fills in the hostname.
  Now javascript could potentially fix that by making another request
  to itself.
- Document missing configuration options in `etc/keter-config.yaml`

## 1.7

- Add support Aeson 2.*
- Add `Data.Aeson.KeyHelper.hs` in cabal file.
- And use the module where Aeson has changed how to handle Key and KeyMap.

## 1.6

- Make keter more chatty on boot.
  This allows you to figure out in code where things go wrong.
- Add opt-in debug CLI, allowing you to inspect keters' internal state.
  You can activate it by specifying a cli-port.
- Emit which pid is being killed by keter.
  This helps with process leakage issues,
  for example if the user launches from a bash script without using `exec`.

## 1.5

- Builds with `process` 1.6
- add dependency for `tls-session-manager`
- Add show instance for App
- Add ensure alive timeout config
- Add `nc` example in incoming
- Change to github actions because travis ci stopped working.
- Fix hackage issues in cabal file
- Fix breaking changes with warp-tls.

## 1.3.6

## 1.3.5.3

More correct/complete solution for issue #44. Allows looking up hosts either
with or without port numbers.

## 1.3.5.2

Partial workaround for keter.yaml files that give a port with the hostname.

## 1.3.5.1

Fix bug where the cleanup process would remain running.

## 1.3.5

All stanzas may have the `requires-secure` property to force redirect to HTTPS.
You can set additional environment variables in your global Keter config file.

keter.yaml. Case insensitive hostname lookups.

## 1.3.3

Set the X-Forwarded-Proto header

Enable GZIP middleware

## 1.3.1

Upgrade to WAI 3.0

## 1.3.0

## 1.0.1

Permit use of wildcard subdomains and exceptions to wildcards. Convert internal
strings to use Data.Text in more places. (Although internationalized domain
names are not supported unless entered in punycode in configuration files.)

## 1.0.0

Significant overhaul. We now support monitoring of much more arbitrary jobs
(e.g., background tasks), have a proper plugin system (PostgreSQL is no longer
a required component), and have a much better system for tracking hostname
mapping changes.

## 0.4.0

Switch to fsnotify to get cross-platform support. No longer using raw proxies,
but instead WAI proxies.

## 0.3.7

Sending a HUP signal reloads the list of deployed apps. This is useful for
circumstances where inotify does not work correctly, such as on file systems
which do not support it.

## 0.3.5

You can now create Keter bundles without any applications. These can contain
static hosts and redirects.
