# Keter can act as a reverse proxy for other servers in your network
# so that it can replace a front-end nginx or apache server. Example:
# reverse-proxy:
#   - reversed-host: internal-service          # hostname of internal server
#     reversed-port: 8080                      # port to access
#     ssl: False                               # whether to use SSL to access internal server
#     reversing-host: service.example.com      # Keter will reverse proxy requests for this host to your server
#     # Keter also supports rewriting headers. See the README.md for more information.
#     rewrite-response:
#       - header: Location
#         from: ^http://internal-service.example.com
#         to: https://service.example.com
